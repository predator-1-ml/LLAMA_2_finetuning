0,"### Human : Hi Sophie, thank you so much for your feedback. I'm sorry we didn't hit our usual high standards for your stay and we will certainly investigate with our team your comments about the rubbish and cleanliness. It's a shame you didn't let us know about any of this when you'd arrived and when we'd checked with you you had settled in and all was ok as we would have most certainly got this addressed straight away. Our Service fee is not just to cover the cleaning but also be linen and utilities and is comparable to other homes operating in this area. Even, so just like you, we expect high standards of our team for our guests.  I have therefore organised via Airbnb to refund you for the Service Fee and an additional refund for the disappointment we caused. We've also sent in our maintenance team to investigate and repair any maintenance points you've raised, I've checked out maintenance report from the team prior to your stay and none of these items had been picked up so they must be very recent and so they had not been spotted prior to your stay. 
I notice you scored us low for communication and slow response, looking at our logs we generally responded within in less than 1 hour, often with 10 -15 minutes, we will of course and we always try to be pro-active by reaching out to guests and checking they have got everything they need ahead of their stay, arrived safely and got checked in and more importantly that all is ok. I can see from our logs that we have been proactive with our communications and only wish we'd had the chance to rectify the points you've raised  during your stay. 
We're glad you were able to make good use of the park with your dog and found the bathroom and other aspects of the house enjoyable during your stay. 
Thanks again for the feedback.

3,"### Human : Hi Yasmin, just an update on your reimbursement request for the car rental you purchased. I tried to raise it with the management earlier unfortunately it was not approved. 

As mentioned previously, the document you signed for the compensation already includes the transportation, meal, and other expenses that you may have during your stay in San Diego for the egg retrieval. 

Please note that we are no longer reimbursing donors separately for expenses due to the fact that the flight airfare and hotel accommodation prices and other medical expenses related to egg donation drastically went up. With this, all expenses are now inclusive in the offer you are given.

As much as we'd love to continue your cycle now or to refund you for the car rental, we are only able to process any compensation on our end after the egg retrieval is successfully completed.

We also will be updating you promptly the next time that you will start the cycle so you can make final arrangements only when it is confirmed that your cycle is continued. Please expect further communication from Dina, your IVF coordinator, with any updates after the baseline ultrasound and bloodwork results are completed and reviewed by our physician. I will be assisting you with the flight tickets and hotel reservation as well as the processing of the compensation and reimbursement after the egg retrieval. The reimbursement includes any medications (bcps, CoQ10) that you paid out of pocket. Please keep the receipts for those or take a picture for safekeeping.

5,"### Human : 1. The tenant did not talk to the cleaner about doing the laundry or the toilet because they are next to the house, the cleaner had the opportunity to see how it was and it is in terrible condition, there is no place where there is no mold, it is everywhere, I think It could be washed with high pressure, however, I don't think this mold will come out and it would also be an additional cost.

2. Wall washing is not included in the service. All the walls of the house have a lot of mold, we would have to wash them and this would have an additional cost, however, we prefer not to do it because it is most likely that the mold will not come out (our cleaner talked to the tenant and told him about this situation)

3. The house has 4 rooms, and 1 bathroom, however, room 1 was in such poor condition that the tenant told us that he would clean it himself, for this reason, it was not charged, we only charge 3 rooms and 1 bath.

4. Blinds are not included in the service but they can be added with a extra charge of $16 per set.

In accordance with the above, our cleaner could go back and do what is highlighted below, which is what corresponds to us.

Lounge room – light fitting 
Kitchen - light fitting, sides of the oven. 
Dining room – Cupboard inside and top.
Bed 2 – Inside Window.
Bed 4 - light fitting
Bathroom – top of the shower 

In conclusion, everything else would have an additional cost, however, there is a lot of mold to remove and we don't think we have the tools to do it.

7,"### Human : I am Brian Walsh, the father of Kyle Walsh, who played on the 3rd grade team last year. With tryouts upcoming and the season not far behind I was wondering if you knew who would be coaching the 4th grade team this year. Last season in my humble opinion was a disaster and an embarrassment to the MYAA program. The 3rd grade team was nowhere near ready to play the other teams at the start of the season nor at the end of the season. This unfortunately had to do with the coaching of the team. I really don't want to get into the gritty details by email of my thoughts but do not want the 4th grade team to be what the third grade team was which was poorly coached and never ready to play.I hesitate to say this but am being asked by a few other parents to make my thoughts known as my son was by far the best on the team and has only gotten better in the last year, playing and staring on high level AAU teams mainly with HoopGroup Shoreshots Inferno and winning tournaments all over the tristate. I can not allow him to play again on a team coached by John Werner. He did such a disservice to my child and the team as a whole. I am hoping that with my strong urging and what I am being told by other former player parents' strong feelings of last season we can move in the direction of a new coach. One that will allow a competitive team to be fielded with a goal of winning games and having a season that could be considered a success over another embarrassment

9,"### Human : Hi Anne, 
Thanks for your message. We're sorry to hear about your Mum's fall on the stairs and have taken your adivce to add additional details to the description of the property with the following: Please note: 
""This property is a traditional Victorian terrace and therefore the stairs might not be suitable for people with mobility issues. However, there is a downstairs bathroom with walk-in shower and a single bed in the snug and also double sofa bed in the living room for guests preferring to remain downstairs.""
We had already ticked on the option that the property has stairs to access room upstairs.
Our advice would be in future to contact your hosts to let them know of your situation. If you had contact us by phone, text, email or booking.com messages we could have helped. There is a ground floor bathroom and a single bedroom and also a double sofa bed in the living room that we could have popped round to prepare for you. Alternatively we could have moved you to our two bedroom ground floor apartment next door at no extra cost. 

I've passed on your suggestion regarding an additional handrail on the stairs and also to take a look at the carpet that was recently fitted to see if this can be adjusted. 

Thanks again for getting in touch and we hope your mum recovers soon.

Kind  regards

Ross

10,"### Human : Hi Michal,

Thank you for reaching out and sharing your concerns. I apologize if my previous message did not reach you. I understand that you have some questions, and I want to make sure I provide you with the right information.

Firstly, I want to explain that before proceeding with any treatments, it is essential for us to establish you as a patient at our facility. This initial consultation serves the purpose of understanding your needs and developing an appropriate treatment plan.

Regarding your technical questions, it would be best to consult with the lab or our physician directly. While we can provide you with basic information about costs and processes, more detailed queries such as treatment plans, protocols, and storage options require a comprehensive consultation with the physician who can provide you with precise guidance.

Also, we already offer a highly competitive package for our cycles. Unfortunately, we do not provide additional discounts for multiple packages.

Please let us know if you are interested in scheduling a consultation with our Dr. Once we have established your care and developed a protocol specifically for you, we can discuss the cost more accurately.

The last two messages you sent us were on April that implied you did not want us to contact you about the randoms since you were aware you had till June 30th and we sounded “threatening” which was never our intention to make you feel that way.

Please see screenshot:





We are aware that you will be testing your Drivers on your own. Please note that we need  a copy of the CCF as a form of proof that your Drivers by the end of business day on June 30th (This will be utilized as proof that they went in to do the required FMCSA DOT Random Drug Test within the quarter) once you have received those results please email them as well to randoms@verticalidentity.com

Please note failure to provide documentation that the tests have been completed will result in you being reported to FMCSA in failure to fulfill your responsibilities as a DER. (This is not a threat, it is a fact) 
An FMCSA Agent will then determine whether or not pursue the case which then you can provide the documentation you failed to provide us.

We will also go ahead and send you a cancellation letter on June 30th that you can complete on July 1st or whenever you choose to end your service with us.

He can speak and understand a little Spanish. He introduces us to his children, Hannah and Jacob and of how wanting his chiledren to learn Spanish as well. He dreams to have 3 children since his brother and sister has 3 children. He did asked Mairelis what she likes to do for fun. Mairelis simply answered she enjoys watching TV, specifically Netflix. GC has a very strong support system, her mom will come over to help her and also her child's dad lives close with her with his wife and they have a good relationship and are willing to help her. She is ok with communicating (sending pics, ultrasound etc.) Did not have issues with previous pregnancy. Both are open to communicate with each other throughout the journey regardless with language barrier. Dr. Dreskin shared that his brother can speak Spanish and may ask help from him. I did sense any problem or issue during the entire meeting. Dr. Dreskin informed GC that she can take all the time she needs to decide since he understands that this is a big decisioin to make.

15,"### Human : Okay so our process is unlike any other online or traditional  dealership. Once we get income verified then we will get all the details of the loan such as interest rate and how much you qualify for. Then I will start showing you vehicles that are fully approved in full email presentations.

The full email presentation will include 8 - 10 pictures, a list of all the features, carfax showing no accidents, and a full financial breakdown with price, discount and payments. Once we find you the right vehicle we will deliver it to you at no charge and at no risk.

Our risk free delivery is exactly as it sounds, no risk to you. Once the vehicle arrives, I want you to look it over and take it for a drive. If there is anything wrong with the vehicle, if there is anything wrong with the paperwork or if I mislead you in any way, just simply refuse the delivery. The only way this works is if the vehicle shows up perfect and I have been completely truthful to you. And of course, our business model wouldn't work if people were refusing deliveries because we were not being upfront and honest.

Does that sound fair?

17,"### Human : Hi Tracy, I was just calling you regarding the issue with the Service fee yesterday. We've looked into the matter with VRBO and it would seem there is a glitch in the system where it is not consistently including the service fee. We have logged this with the technical support team to address ASAP.  However, we recognise that it's not your issue this was not displayed and want to apologise on behalf of ourselves and VRBO.  I'd like to organise to refund this payment to you so wanted to get the last 4 digits of your card that you used for payment so I can process the refund. 

We appreciate this glitch also meant our system thought a payment was outstanding so didn't release the access code for the the 3pm check-in.  By way of apology we'd also like to provide you with a £40 credit to use towards a future booking at any of the TLC properties. We'll email you the credit and details of how to use it on a future booking. 

In the meantime if you can please let us know the last 4 digits of your payment card and I'll organise the refund. 

Kind regards

Ross

18,"### Human : Dear Dr. Bojos,

Greetings!

I am composing this letter to show my eagerness to pursue a Teaching Internship at Cebu Normal University - Integrated Laboratory School (CNU - ILS) as a component of my academic obligation for this term. This is done in part to meet the requirements of the EDUC - 15 course, which will afford me the opportunity to gain experience in actual teaching scenarios.
Being an Elementary Education student has allowed me to handle students with different personalities that require me to be passionate about my work. I have consistently made it to the Dean's List, and I am adaptable to both online and face-to-face classrooms. It has also allowed me to manage time and people efficiently, which enables me to cater to my colleagues' diverse needs. I am excited to work as a Teaching Intern, gain valuable skills, carry out my responsibilities, meet all criteria, behave appropriately, and take responsibility for my tasks throughout the internship.

19,"### Human : Hello Danita, I just spoke with your IPs today. They are very worried about what happened to you, informed them that baby is fine, and you are recovering from the accident. One thing they would want to know, if what are medications you are taking, they are worried with the medications you might take for your injury. It is better to ask for approval by your OB doctor before taking any medication. Also, they are asking if you could just ride Uber on your appointments, and you will be reimbursed. They requested to please not drive during this stage, to avoid some accidents that might happen. They are thankful that you are okay now, and also they want to extend their well wishes to you, they are praying for your full recovery and they wanted to give you flowers and gift cards for appreciation. They want you to relax and take things easy during this stage. They want just the best for you and the baby, for both of you to be healthy until delivery. \ud83d\udc9b

21,"### Human : Hi Michal,

Thank you so much for your response, I may have missed this on my inbox but to answer your questions first I wanted to inform you that we could not proceed with any treatments to a patient unless we establish them first as a patient to our facility and this is the purpose of this initial consultation.

1. Any technical questions would have to be answered by the lab themselves or the physician. We are only able to provide you with the basic information for cost and processes. More detailed or technical questions such as treatment plan or protocols and storage options will require a full consultation with the physician. 

2.Since we already have a very competitive package price for our cycles, we do not offer any additional discounts for multiple packages.

Please let us know if you are interested in a consultation with our Dr. once we have established care and a protocol we can discuss the cost more accurately.

Additionally, we'll take a closer look at the TV. Could you please let me know if you've had any issues with the streaming services such as BBC and ITV Iplayers?

25,"### Human : Sure thing. We just had plumber out to look at upstairs master shower. The issue unfortunately is this - the pin is stuck and unable to move. This is why the water won't get to cold when you turn it. The only way to fix for this is to drill the pin out, which they can try, and if successful they would just need to replace the handle. BUT - they did warn us, that most likely drilling it would destroy the fixture and would then need to replace the whole fixture. They are looking to see if that exact same fixture is even available, if not a new one would need to be put in that you could choose. At this point there is nothing else that can be done with that fixture it sounds like. So to summarize - they can try drilling it, if successful they can just get a new handle, if not the fixture will need to be replaced. Do we have your ok to move forward?

There has been a change in our Terms and Conditions that if there's no credit note requested within the 90 days a service has been ordered, we do not provide a credit note and the service has to be paid at full price. However, as a one time exception we went ahead and submitted a credit note request of $49.00 for the Pre-Employment drug test for Brandon Cunningham even though that test was ordered back in September of 2022. Please note that you can only send Ryquerrius Williams or W.C. Bell Jr for the Random Drug and Alcohol test since Justin has not taken his Pre-Employment yet. If Justin is currently driving for you it is crucial he takes his pre-employment drug test since it is against DOT guidelines to have a Driver on the road that has not had a negative pre-employment DOT Drug Test Result.

I was also saddened to learn that you had a dog staying with you at our property that we were unaware of and had not agreed to. There is damage to the carpet from dog urination in the property and so we have had to organise a carpet clean and deep cleaned. We have cancelled your booking at Dornning Street and whilst the full amount is the cancellation fee we doubt very much we will hear from you so have therefore applied a £75 charge to be deducted from your original security deposit. A further  £75 charge has been applied to pay toward the cost of the carpet clean and deep clean, this will also be deducted from your security deposit.

We understand that your health and well-being must come first. With this said, we don't want to risk letting you proceed with this cycle and starting the stimulation medications when you currently are experiencing pain in your legs. Please have the Doppler scan and kindly send us the results when it is available so the medical team can review and can confirm you can start the cycle again.

We appreciate your willingness to donate and your commitment to helping others. It is unfortunate that we were not able to make it happen at this time.

For now, I will be ordering your birth control pills and azithromycin (Zpak), but I wanted to first confirm which local pharmacy you prefer to get them from. You can provide the pharmacy's phone number and address.

I'm glad to hear that BRI1270 is a good match for you. Good thing that you informed me about your top candidate because I learned during our meeting earlier today that another Intended Parent from my colleague is interested in reserving the entire batch of eggs from BRI1270. Additionally, I have two other Intended Parents who have their eyes on this donor. 

In her previous cycle, another Intended Parent also reserved the entire batch of her eggs, and as a result, my Intended Parent missed the opportunity to purchase eggs from this donor.

Considering the high demand for this donor, I strongly recommend securing the eggs from BRI1270 as soon as possible before it's too late.

67,"### Human : Hello Ana,

I am very happy to hear that the transfer went well today!

1. Your 1st bloodwork is on 7/05/2023, testing progesterone level.

As a friendly reminder, unlike spontaneous pregnancies, FET pregnancies are tenuous, and can easily be lost following vigorous activities or intercourse. Therefore, to ensure a successful pregnancy, we recommend strict bedrest for 24 hours after the transfer and refrain from having intercourse or strenuous activities during the first 12 weeks of your pregnancy. Avoid lifting anything heavier than 10 pounds, hot bath, and swimming pools.

Thank you so much and Good luck with everything!
-Gia

94,"### Human : So just a bit of background about me. My name is Thea, senior manager of Lucina Egg Bank. Before switching over to the Medical and fertility world, I was working in the banking industry for over 7 years. During this time, I saw so many of my colleagues who missed the chance of having their own families. This is actually quite common in our industry as well. Even a very close friend of mine had to use donor eggs and a surrogate to complete her family dream. By watching her go through that journey, it helped me solidify my decision to move to this profession.

Just wanted to give an update regarding my concern about not receiving New Patient forms submitted online on my end. The issue is still the same.

I have asked Jen and she's also not receiving anything. I am not sure how is it for Monica right now.

I am asking for your assistance again on this matter. Thank you so much.

It must be disappointing to be drawn in by the lowest advertised price only to spend hours being dragged around, only to find out that you may not qualify for the car you really want.
